SHINY App

My App is a Simple Calculator that illustrates the difference of Time Value of Money between Simple and Compound Interest. 

Specifically:
- You enter the annual interest Rate in percent
- You use a slidebar to set the number of months
- A plot is generated illustrating the difference between simple interest and compound interest over time
